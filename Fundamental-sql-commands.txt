> List the commands for adding, updating, and deleting data.

A. Adding data 
	INSERT INTO Patients (Id, First, Last, Dob)
	VALUES (1, 'Farooq', 'Badruddin', '1974-04-29')
	
	Updating data
		UPDATE Patients 
		SET Dob = '0974-04-01' 
		WHERE Id = 1
	
	Deleting data
		DELETE FROM Patients 
		WHERE Id = 1

> Explain the structure for each type of command.
	Insert command 
		INSERT INTO TableName (column1, column2.....column n) //in our  case the first type is of int, second type is string, third type is string and the last type is of date
		VALUES (value1, value2....value n) // id, string, string, date
	
	Update command 
		UPDATE TableName 
		SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2....column n = value n
		WHERE SomeColumn = SomeValue // WHERE is a filter operation, we can chain multiple filters by using the AND keyword e.g WHERE First = 'Farooq' AND Last='Badruddin'
	
	Delete Command
		DELETE From TableName
		WHERE SomeColumn = SomeValue // this will remove a row from the database. Like the Update command, we can have multiple filters using the AND keyword
		

> What are some of the data types that can be used in tables? Give a real-world example of each type.

A. Real world example - SQL Server
	VARCHAR - for string datatypes
	INT - for integers
	BIT - for boolean, essentially 0 or 1
	DATE - Date datatypes
	DATETIME - Date AND Time
	DECIMAL - floating point datatypes
