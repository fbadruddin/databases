A. Databases act as repository of data that is stored across a number of tables in a relational manner or documents in a non-relational setup. The end result is the same as it is a resting place for all data to be stored that is then accessed by applications via business logic for mobile/web or desktop applications. The data is asked for by the business logic, that data is then arranged in a manner that it is converted to meaningful information for the user who requested it and is then presented to the user on the front end.
